# Dynamic

The Dynamic Download Creator From Redcodi Games!

## How to use Dynamic
Currently Dynamic has no GUI, and must be setup manually! (This will change in the future!)

 1. Open the `Internal` folder, and open `Dynamic.bat` in your [favorite text editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)!
 2. Replace line 6 with the URL, and file name you want the file to save as (Does not have to be the original file name). For example `powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "URL" -OutFile "Output.txt"`.
 3. Replace line 7 with the file name you told it to save as
 4. Change line 8 to have the file name, or remove it to disable removing after running.
 5. Save, close the file, and run `Comp.bat` (Still in the `Internal` folder!).
 6. The output EXE should be available in `Builds`!
